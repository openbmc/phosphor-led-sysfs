      "message": "I\u0027m partially surprised by clang-tidy recommending this particular syntax, but I guess if it works go with it.\n\nfs::path(foo) and fs::path({foo}) are potentially two different constructors.  The second one takes an initializer_list.\n\nTelling developers to prefer {} seems to be, as a habit, inhibiting them from thinking about which constructor they are intending to call and sometimes inadvertently shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nstd::vector\u003csize_t\u003e is the prototypical case where `std::vector({len, val})` and `std::vector(len, val)` have drastically different meanings and using `return {len, val}` leads to the first and not the second.\n\nI\u0027m probably not smarter than the authors of clang-tidy though...",
