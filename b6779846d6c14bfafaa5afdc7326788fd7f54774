      "message": "This drops `std::transform(name.begin(), name.end(), name.begin(), ::tolower);` which is also called within phosphor-ledmanager. Previously this causes all LEDs to have the same case, but now the name on DBus is different.\nThus it breaks using any LED on my system as the LEDs on DBus have now upper case names. How to fix this issue?",

      "message": "I think the intent is that this service (led-sysfs) is using the same names as the kernel presents, which come from the device tree, right?  I guess you can either fix the device tree or fix the led-manager config to match?  Is there any issue with that?\n\nWhat is \"my system\"?  Is the code for it upstream?",

      "message": "The intent doesn\u0027t matter. It changes the behaviour without mentioning in the commit message. It breaks existing upstream platforms since it previously converted upper case characters to lower case characters.\nphosphor-led-manager also automatically converts dbus names to lower case.\nWith this commit applied phosphor-led-manager won\u0027t find the LEDs any more since they now also have upper case letters.\n\nWhy do I have to change multiple other components (devicetree, led-manager code, led-manager config) just to fix this regression?\nThe fix is here: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-led-sysfs/+/77238",
