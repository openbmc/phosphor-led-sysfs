I left a similar remark in https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-led-sysfs/+/57455 .\n\nIt seems like the \"regression\" is only affecting a downstream system.  Why should we potentially break upstream systems at the expense of one downstream?  If the author has an upstream system that is broken, can they point to it?
